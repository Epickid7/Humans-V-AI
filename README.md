### Troubleshooting
#### Long Build Time
The first time the program is ran, it could take a long time depending on internet speed and CPU speed. This CMake will
fetch SFML 3.0.0 from the SFML GitHub page. It will then "make" the SFML library on your computer. "make" means to
compile the library locally on your machine. This ensures compatability with your machine.


### Reminders For the Assignment
*Read the assignment ***multiple*** times*. Ensure you comply with all requirements.

Git is not a requirement, but a suggestion. This will allow you to collaborate without much issue. *If you choose to use git, please ensure your repo is **private** during development.*

Have fun with this project! It does not need to be a game; it could a utility application or anything including a
Graphical User Interface. Try to pick a project which you want to showcase on your resume.

Ensure all group members are contributing and notify the professor and your TA if there are concerns about this.

**AI should not be used on any part of this assigment.**
