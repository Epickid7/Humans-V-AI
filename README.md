[GitHub Desktop Download](https://desktop.github.com/download/) (GUI Git Client Linux, Windows, macOS)

[Create a .gitignore file](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) (Generates gitignore. Simply save the file to your repo as .gitignore) 

To share the repo with groupmates:
1. Navigate to your repo on GitHub
2. Click Settings
3. In the left column, select "Collaborators"
4. In the right column, click "Add People"
5. Type all your groupmate's username

### Troubleshooting
#### Long Build Time
The first time the program is ran, it could take a long time depending on internet speed and CPU speed. This CMake will
fetch SFML 3.0.0 from the SFML GitHub page. It will then "make" the SFML library on your computer. "make" means to
compile the library locally on your machine. This ensures compatability with your machine.

#### Failing to Build
If this project does not build due to git missing, please install git using one of the methods mentioned above. Then,
restart your computer.

If the project does not build, try deleting all folders **within** the `out` and `cmake-build-debug` folders. Please do
not delete the folders themselves. Only delete all contents **within**.

#### Tested Environments
The project was tested in Visual Studio and CLion on Windows and CLion on macOS. These methods are guaranteed to work.
However, there were some complications where Visual Studio was reluctant to build the first time.


### Reminders For the Assignment
*Read the assignment ***multiple*** times*. Ensure you comply with all requirements.

Git is not a requirement, but a suggestion. This will allow you to collaborate without much issue. *If you choose to use git, please ensure your repo is **private** during development.*

Have fun with this project! It does not need to be a game; it could a utility application or anything including a
Graphical User Interface. Try to pick a project which you want to showcase on your resume.

Ensure all group members are contributing and notify the professor and your TA if there are concerns about this.

**AI should not be used on any part of this assigment.**
